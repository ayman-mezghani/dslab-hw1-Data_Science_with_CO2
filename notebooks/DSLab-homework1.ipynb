The main goal of the project is to improve the understanding of the small-scale CO2 fluxes in Switzerland and concurrently to contribute to a better top-down quantification of the Swiss CO2 emissions. The Carbosense network has a spatial focus on the City of Zurich where more than 50 sensors are deployed. Network operations started in July 2017.\n",

    "## Description of the homework\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we will curate a set of **CO2 measurements**, measured from cheap but inaccurate sensors, that have been deployed in the city of Zurich from the Carbosense project. The goal of the exercise is twofold: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn how to deal with real world sensor timeseries data, and organize them efficiently using python dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply data science tools to model the measurements, and use the learned model to process them (e.g., detect drifts in the sensor measurements). \n",
    "\n",
    "The sensor network consists of 46 sites, located in different parts of the city. Each site contains three different sensors measuring (a) **CO2 concentration**, (b) **temperature**, and (c) **humidity**. Beside these measurements, we have the following additional information that can be used to process the measurements: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **altitude** at which the CO2 sensor is located, and the GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A clustering of the city of Zurich in 17 different city **zones** and the zone in which the sensor belongs to. Some characteristic zones are industrial area, residential area, forest, glacier, lake, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prior knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "The average value of the CO2 in a city is approximately 400 ppm. However, the exact measurement in each site depends on parameters such as the temperature, the humidity, the altitude, and the level of traffic around the site. For example, sensors positioned in high altitude (mountains, forests), are expected to have a much lower and uniform level of CO2 than sensors that are positioned in a business area with much higher traffic activity. Moreover, we know that there is a strong dependence of the CO2 measurements, on temperature and humidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this knowledge, you are asked to define an algorithm that curates the data, by detecting and removing potential drifts. **The algorithm should be based on the fact that sensors in similar conditions are expected to have similar measurements.** \n",
    "\n",
    "## To start with\n",
    "\n",
    "The following csv files in the `../data/carbosense-raw/` folder will be needed: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `CO2_sensor_measurements.csv`\n",
    "    \n",
    "   __Description__: It containts the CO2 measurements `CO2`, the name of the site `LocationName`, a unique sensor identifier `SensorUnit_ID`, and the time instance in which the measurement was taken `timestamp`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. `temperature_humidity.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "   __Description__: It contains the temperature and the humidity measurements for each sensor identifier, at each timestamp `Timestamp`. For each `SensorUnit_ID`, the temperature and the humidity can be found in the corresponding columns of the dataframe `{SensorUnit_ID}.temperature`, `{SensorUnit_ID}.humidity`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. `sensor_metadata.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "   __Description__: It contains the name of the site `LocationName`, the zone index `zone`, the altitude in meters `altitude`, the longitude `lon`, and the latitude `lat`. \n",
